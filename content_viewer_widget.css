FILE DESCRIPTION
This is the CSS library that drives the Content Viewer Widget.

WIDGET DESCRIPTION
This Jive HTML widget is driven by a modified Table of Contents widget.  When a TOC entry 
is clicked, the click event is intercepted and the associated hyperlink is loaded and 
formatted for display in the defined viewer area on the Overview page.  This allows a rich 
set of content to be accessed on a single page without having to set up complex navigation 
between pages.
